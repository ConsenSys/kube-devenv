* ROADMAP

Lots of things to improve

- ensure OSX compliance
- currently skaffold only manages one image. Make it working with multiple images (build or already available, like nginx)
- secret management. Add secrets locally ( secrets.yaml?) , then add that file to .gitignore
- tls support? cert-manager
- add stuff here
